# systemchatter
This is like a thing that makes it look like the game is saying whatever message you put, sorta like those ChatHax but instead it does it to the game, this is good for trolling friends
or maybe sometimes trolling the entire server, this might not always work to scare people but it does.

# How It Works
It uses the Roblox defualt chat GUI as a advantage, taking up the characters to make it make a new line, making it look like another person!
